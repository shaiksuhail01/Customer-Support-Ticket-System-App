- **Database** : MongoDB

## Data Structures

## Queue
Purpose: Tickets are stored in a queue to manage submission order. New tickets are enqueued, and theyâ€™re processed in a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order to maintain service fairness.
Implementation: The backend uses a custom queue data structure to manage ticket processing. This is useful for scenarios where ticket priority may later be introduced based on severity or other factors.

## Linked List
Purpose: Resolved tickets are stored in a linked list for easy insertion and deletion, especially when tickets need to be archived and accessed sequentially.
Implementation: A singly linked list structure is used to keep track of resolved tickets. The head of the list points to the most recently resolved ticket, allowing for efficient removal and storage.
